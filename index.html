            Thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required. The WHO
            also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and
            water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet
            or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing
            one's nose.In the absence of soap and water, you can use an
            alcohol-based sanitiser, where the alcohol content is at least
            60-95%..

            What is COVID-19? COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called
            SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some
            people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19
            get better within weeks of illness, some people experience
            post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of
            new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience
            more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that
            causes COVID-19. Older people and those who have certain underlying
            medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from
            COVID-19. Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.

            Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?
            Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your
            family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water
            for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose,
            coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or
            preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an
            alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

            mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after
